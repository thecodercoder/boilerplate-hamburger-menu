# Boilerplate Hamburger Menu

This website is a boilerplate example of an accessible hamburger menu, using CSS, vanilla JS, and the [Body Scroll
Lock Upgrade plugin by Rick Liruixin](https://github.com/rick-liruixin/body-scroll-lock-upgrade).

A lot of the code is from what I learned from the [Practical Accessibility](https://practical-accessibility.today/) course by [Sara Soueidan](https://sarasoueidan.com/).
